  Palak and Bibek reached out to us to design their wedding invitation card.
  They wanted their card to be as special as their wedding and something minimal
  & different from the traditional Nepali-Indian wedding cards.

  We worked together with Bibek and Palak discussing on how the card should look
  like and what information would go in each page of the card. We started with
  an initial interview with them understanding about their daily life, work they
  do, their interests/ hobbies, how they met and fell for each other, who their
  family members are and so on. Getting to know them closer helped us to bring
  out character in the invitation card.
