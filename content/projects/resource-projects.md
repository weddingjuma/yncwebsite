  Resource Projects is a platform that collects and presents information on oil,
  gas and mining payments. They needed a web design that communicates who they
  are and presents their data about extractive projects.

block_description_1: >-
  From the beginning, the idea was to make a minimal design but one that would
  also make the site look rich with information. Resource projects deals with
  information on resources such as oil, gas and mining. So we took inspiration
  from mineral resources for the look and feel of the site. As is the case with 
  most design projects, there were multiple back and forth in communication with
  the client before we finalized on the design. It helped that we worked in
  phases where the project began with only displaying tabular data followed by
  adding visualizations and refining them.
