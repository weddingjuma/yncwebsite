      Resource Projects is a platform that collects and presents information on
      oil, gas and mining payments. They needed a web design that communicates
      who they are and presents their data about extractive projects.

      From the beginning, the idea was to make a minimal design but one that
      would also make the site look rich with information. Resource projects
      deals with information on resources such as oil, gas and mining. So we
      took inspiration from mineral resources for the look and feel of the site.
      As is the case with  most design projects, there were multiple back and
      forth in communication with the client before we finalized on the design.
      It helped that we worked in phases where the project began with only
      displaying tabular data followed by adding visualizations and refining
      them.
