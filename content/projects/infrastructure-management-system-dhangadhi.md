      The mayor of Dhangadhi wanted to get an overview of projects running in
      his constituency. Most of the municipalities in Nepal still rely on
      traditional methods of using physical files to document records of
      infrastructure projects. This hindered efficiency and delayed any action
      to be taken where needed.

      We helped design a dashboard that helped the officials/ engineers at the
      municipality to visualize the current status of projects related to
      infrastructure. In addition to that, we also designed an app that allowed
      anyone to provide feedback and/ or monitor any running projects.
