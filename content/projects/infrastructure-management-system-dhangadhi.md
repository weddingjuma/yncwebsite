title: Infrastructure Management System - Dhangadhi
brief_description: Visualizing municipalitiesâ€™ infrastructure projects

block_title: Challenge/ Problem
block_description: >-
  The mayor of Dhangadhi wanted to get an overview of projects running in his
  constituency. Most of the municipalities in Nepal still rely on traditional
  methods of using physical files to document records of infrastructure
  projects. This hindered efficiency and delayed any action to be taken where
  needed.

block_title_1: Our Approach
block_description_1: >-
  We helped design a dashboard that helped the officials/ engineers at the
  municipality to visualize the current status of projects related to
  infrastructure. In addition to that, we also designed an app that allowed
  anyone to provide feedback and/ or monitor any running projects.
