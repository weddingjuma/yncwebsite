      Palak and Bibek reached out to us to design their wedding invitation card.
      They wanted their card to be as special as their wedding and something
      minimal & different from the traditional Nepali-Indian wedding cards.

      We worked together with Bibek and Palak discussing on how the card should
      look like and what information would go in each page of the card. We
      started with an initial interview with them understanding about their
      daily life, work they do, their interests/ hobbies, how they met and fell
      for each other, who their family members are and so on. Getting to know
      them closer helped us to bring out character in the invitation card.
