  Smart Urban Technology Challenge is a competition organized by Kathmandu
  Metropolitan City  to bring out entrepreneurial spirit within Nepalese
  community to identify and solve problems related to urban development. KMC
  needed a brand identity system that would communicate their competitionâ€™s
  objectives to young entrepreneurs who are looking to build a start-up in this
  space.

block_title_1: Our Approach
block_description_1: >-
  We started by looking for things that represented Kathmandu city and objects/
  concepts that represented smart & technology. We played and built the brand
  identity around these objects. We also went around the city to take pictures
  of billboards, overhead bridges, traffic booths where the advertisements of
  the competition were to be displayed.
