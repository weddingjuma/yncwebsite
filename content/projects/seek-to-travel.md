  Seek To Travel is a platform that helps travelers connect with local travel
  agents. They reached out to us through a common friend and wanted to use our
  services to help them establish a brand to reach their goal of connecting
  travelers and travel agencies.

block_description_1: >-
  A detailed discussion with the client made it clear that they wanted a luxury
  brand that represented travel. We started with the logo. The idea of using a
  compass came in from the client during one of our design meetings. We liked
  the idea and started from there. The compass was tweaked a bit to look like
  the initial letter “S”. Along with this, we presented 2 other options, but in
  the end, the compass one got approved. 




  For the web platform, we went with a minimal and luxury feel. A lot of spaces
  were used in the website’s design to create a feel of relaxation for the
  users.
