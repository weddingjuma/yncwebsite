block_description: >-
  BUCSBIN is a project with an objective to increase university capacity in
  Nepal for developing entrepreneurship education and business incubation

block_title_1: Our Approach
block_description_1: >-
  We talked to various stakeholders to understand how the project worked and
  what the aim of the project was. We got to know their process of teaching and
  conducting workshops. This helped us to know that their approach was very
  casual, fresd, not formal-at-all and yet very effective! We chose the green
  color, type and elements of wave that would reflect this casual, freshness and
  new wave of change.
