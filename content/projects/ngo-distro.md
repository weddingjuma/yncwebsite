  NGO Distro is a Content Management System (CMS) targeted towards the NGOs (Non
  Government Organizations) of Nepal. Most of the NGOs in Nepal donâ€™t have
  capacity and resources to create and maintain website. To fill this gap,
  YoungInnovations has created a tool that is customizable, easy to setup and
  easy to use. Y&C took on the challenge to design the visual identity and
  themes for this tool.

block_title_1: Our Approach
block_description_1: >-
  We started with designing the logo playing around the letters N, G and O to
  form a monogram. Fiddling around this idea gave birth to a mark that looked
  like a fingerprint. This also matched with our mission of building a tool that
  would help NGOs to create a website with simple taps of their fingertips. 


  For the landing page, we wanted to look different than other CMSs out there.
  So we chose to go with a bit of  retro-look. Apart from landing page and the
  logo, we've also designed several themes for the CMS.
