      NGO Distro is a Content Management System (CMS) targeted towards the NGOs
      (Non Government Organizations) of Nepal. Most of the NGOs in Nepal donâ€™t
      have capacity and resources to create and maintain website. To fill this
      gap, YoungInnovations has created a tool that is customizable, easy to
      setup and easy to use. Y&C took on the challenge to design the visual
      identity and themes for this tool.

      The idea started with playing around the letters N, G and O. Fiddling
      around this idea gave birth to a mark that looked like a fingerprint. This
      also matched with our mission of building a tool that would help NGOs to
      create a website with simple taps of their fingertips. 


      For the landing page, we wanted to look different than other CMSs out
      there. So we chose to go with a bit of  retro-look.
