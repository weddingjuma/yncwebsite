block_description: >-
  NGO Distro is a Content Management System (CMS) targeted towards the NGOs (Non
  Government Organizations) of Nepal. Most of the NGOs in Nepal donâ€™t have
  capacity and resources to create and maintain website. To fill this gap,
  YoungInnovations has created a tool that is customizable, easy to setup and
  easy to use. Y&C took on the challenge to design the visual identity and
  themes for this tool.

block_title_1: Our Approach
block_description_1: >-
  The idea started with playing around the letters N, G and O. Fiddling around
  this idea gave birth to a mark that looked like a fingerprint. This also
  matched with our mission of building a tool that would help NGOs to create a
  website with simple taps of their fingertips. 


  For the landing page, we wanted to look different than other CMSs out there.
  So we chose to go with a bit of  retro-look. Check out http://ngodistro.com
